# Kotlin Coroutines - Use Cases on Android

Learning Kotlin Coroutines for Android by Example. Sample Implementations for Common Android Use Cases. Unit Tests included!

This repository is intended to be a "Playground Project". You can quickly look up and play around with the different Coroutine Android implementations.
In the `playground` package you can play around with Coroutines examples that run directly on the JVM.

## Project Setup

Every use case is using its own `Activity` and `JetPack ViewModel`. The `ViewModel`s contains all the interesting Coroutine related code.
`Activities` listen to `LiveData` events of the `ViewModel` and render received `UiState`s.

This project is using retrofit/okhttp together with a `MockNetworkInterceptor`. This lets you define how the API should behave.
Everything can be configured: http status codes, response data and delays. Every use case defines a certain behaviour of the Mock API.
The API has 2 endpoints. One returns the names of the most recent Android versions and the other one returns the features of a certain
Android version.

Unit Tests exist for most use cases.

## Description

### 1. Perform single network request

Performs a single network request to get the latest Android Versions.

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase1/PerformSingleNetworkRequestViewModel.kt)]

### 2. Perform two sequential network requests

Performs two network requests sequentially. First it retrieves recent Android Versions and then it requests the features of the latest version.
There also exists an alternative implementation for this use case which uses traditional callbacks. It should demonstrate how much shorter and more readable the Coroutine version is compared to the approach with callbacks.

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase2/Perform2SequentialNetworkRequestsViewModel.kt)]

### 3. Perform several network requests concurrently

Performs three network requests concurrently. It loads the feature information of the 3 most recent Android Versions. Additionally, an implementation
that performs the requests sequentially is included. The UI shows how much time each implementation takes to load the data so you can see that the network
requests in the concurrent version are actually performed in parallel. The included unit test is also interesting, as it shows how you can use virtual time to
verify that the concurrent version really gets performed in parallel.

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase3/PerformNetworkRequestsConcurrentlyViewModel.kt)]

### 4. Perform variable amount of network requests

Demonstrates the simple usage of `map()` to perform a dynamic amount of network requests. At first, this use case performs a network request to load all Android versions.
Then it performs a network request for each Android version to load its features. It contains an implementation that performs the network requests sequentially and another one that performs them concurrently.

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase4/VariableAmountOfNetworkRequestsViewModel.kt)]

### 5. Perform network request with timeout

This use case uses the suspending function `withTimeout()` from the coroutines-core library. It throws a `TimeoutCancellationException` if the timeout was exceeded.
You can set the duration of the request in the UI and check the behaviour when the response time is bigger than the timeout.

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase5/NetworkRequestWithTimeoutViewModel.kt)]

### 6. Retrying network requests

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase6/RetryNetworkRequestViewModel.kt)]

### 7. Room and Coroutines

This example stores the response data of each network request in a Room database. This is essential for any "offline-first" app.
If the `View` requests data, the `ViewModel` first checks if there is data available in the database. If so, this data is returned before performing
a network request to get fresh data.

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase7/RoomAndCoroutinesViewModel.kt)]

### 8. Debugging Coroutines

Shows how you can add additional debug information about the Coroutine that is currently running to your logs.
It will add the Coroutine name next to the thread name when calling `Thread.currentThread.name()`
This is done by enabling Coroutine Debug mode by setting the property `kotlinx.coroutines.debug` to `true`.
This is how it will look like in LogCat:

### 9. Offload expensive calculation to background thread

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase9/CalculationInBackgroundViewModel.kt)]

### 10. Cooperative cancellation

[[code](https://github.com/LukasLechnerDev/Kotlin-Coroutine-Use-Cases-on-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase10/CooperativeCancellationViewModel.kt)]

### 11. Offload expensive calculation to several Coroutines

[[code viewmodel](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase11/CalculationInMultipleBackgroundThreadsViewModel.kt)]
[[code factorial calculator](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase11/FactorialCalculator.kt)]

### 12. Exception Handling

[[code](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase12/ExceptionHandlingViewModel.kt)]

### 13. Continue Coroutine execution when the user leaves the screen

Sometimes we don't want a certain coroutine operation to be cancelled when the user leaves the screen and therefore the ViewModel
gets cleared. In this use case, we want the network request to keep running and the result still to be inserted into the database
cache when the user leaves the screen. This makes sense in real world application as we don't want to cancel an already started background "cache sync".
You can test this in the UI by clearing the database, then loading the Android version and instantly close the screen. You will see in LogCat that the response
still gets executed and the result still gets stored. The existing Unit Test `AndroidVersionRepositoryTest` also verifies this behavior. Check out this [blogpost](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/coroutines-patterns-for-work-that-shouldnt-be-cancelled-e26c40f142ad) for details of the implementation.

[[code repository](app/src/main/java/com/lukaslechner/coroutineusecasesonandroid/usecases/coroutines/usecase13/AndroidVersionRepository.kt)]

### 14. Using WorkManager with Coroutines

Demonstrates how you can use WorkManager together with Coroutines. When creating a subclass of `CoroutineWorker` instead of `Worker`,
the `doWork()` function is now a `suspend function` which means that we can now call other suspend functions. In this
example, we are sending an analytics request when the user enters the screen, which is a nice use case for using WorkManager.
