# Coroutine Use Cases on Android

This project contains a lot of real-world Android use cases implemented with Kotlin Coroutines, Channels and Flow.

Currently, it is in heavy "Work in Progress". Most of the examples aren't implemented yet.

## Coroutines Use Cases
1. [Performing a single network request](#1-performing-a-single-network-request)
2. [Performing two sequential network request](#2-performing-two-sequential-network-requests)
3. Performing several network requests concurrently
4. Performing a variable amount of network requests, depending on the amount of data sets received from the first network request
5. Performing a network request with a timeout
6. Retrying network requests
7. Room and Coroutines
8. Load data from a cache first, then from the network request using LiveData
9. Offload a heavy calculation from the main thread
10. Offload a heavy calculation to several Coroutines
11. Handling Exceptions
12. Coroutine Cancellation
13. Continue Coroutine execution even when the user has already left the screen
14. Using WorkManager together with Coroutines
15. [Wrapping Callback based API](#15-wrapping-callback-based-api)

## Coroutines Use Cases Description

### 1. Performing a single network request

Almost every real Android application needs to do some networking.

### 2. Performing two sequential network requests

Performs one network request after the other.

### 15. Wrapping callback based API
